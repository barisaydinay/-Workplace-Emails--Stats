# -Workplace-Emails--Stats
It aims to utilize the heap sort and binary search algorithms in a practical  manner. Your main task in this assignment is to organize emails sent and received in a workplace using C programming language.

Overview
A workplace manager wants to study his employeesâ€™ activities based on their exchange of emails.
Henceforth, my task will be to write a program that will get specific stats that the manager wants 
to find out. Heap sort and binary search are prominent algorithms that I have encountered in 
my course, and I will be using them to fetch the stats the manager requests.

My program will read emails from a group of text files and operate on them with the following functionalities:

1. Read a group of data files, each containing an email ID, a sender, a recipient, a date, and the 
content
2. Store the data in an array of email structures
3. Print a menu displaying the stats options that could be fetched
4. Sort emails based on id, number of words, or day
5. Search for emails by ID 
6. Print the results with the respective information
